/* In this query, I assess which cities have the greatest number of authentic Mexican restaurants.
The data tables "locations" and "menu_options_prices" contain the following relevant columns:
locations.id and menu_options_prices.id: A unique identifier for each specific physical restaurant. This disambiguates different instances of the same restaurant, e.g. multiple McDonald's, and links the two data tables.
locations.city: The city in which a restaurant is located
locations.name: The name of the restaurant, e.g., McDonald's or Subway
menu_options_prices.menus_name: The name of the menu item which contains either "burrito" and/or "taco" in its name, e.g., "Bean Cheese Burrito", "Diablo Taco", and "Taco, Burritto Special #1".
menu_options_prices.categories: The type of the restaurant, e.g., "Mexican deli", "art gallery", "Fast food".
menu_options_prices.cuisine: The type of food associated with the restaurant, e.g., "Pizza", "Authentic Mexican", "Tex-Mex"
NOTE!! There is overlap and a lack of specifiticity between categories and cuisine.

/* Because "authentic" is not well operationalized, I used the following criteria.
 1. The restauran has fewer than 5 locations, as authentic restaurants tend to have fewer expansions
 2. The restaurant appears in only 1 city, as a larger chain is less likely to be authentic,
 3. The cuisine/category includes the word Mexican, and
 4. The cuisine does not include specific non-authentic keywords "*/
