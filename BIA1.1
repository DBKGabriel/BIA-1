/* In this query, I count the number of locations for each restaurant that had both tacos and burritos.
The data tables "locations" and "menu_options_prices" contain the following relevant columns:
locations.id and menu_options_prices.id: A unique identifier for each specific physical restaurant. This disambiguates different instances of the same restaurant, e.g. multiple McDonald's, and links the two data tables.
locations.name: The name of the restaurant, e.g., McDonald's or Subway
menu_options_prices.menus_name: The name of the menu item which contains either "burrito" and/or "taco" in its name, e.g., "Bean Cheese Burrito", "Diablo Taco", and "Taco, Burritto Special #1".
